# The Big Data Revolution
## Case Study: Home Sales Analysis

Nearly everything we do today leaves an indelible digital trail: Where we live. What we search. What we read. Where we go. What we buy. What we say. All of this data is being recorded and stored.  The data revolution is unlike anything humanity has ever experienced. Now, every two days, the human race is generating as much data as was generated from the dawn of humanity through the year 2003. Today, individuals in the world’s major cities are exposed to as much information in a single day as their 15th-century ancestors were exposed to in a lifetime. With phones and devices serving as the “on-ramp” for billions of people to access the information network, technology has fundamentally changed the way people interact with everything. Our phones, computers, homes, cars, appliances and a multitude of objects are generating data that can be extracted and used on a mass scale, enabling us to collect, store and process vast quantities of data and then respond in real time.
